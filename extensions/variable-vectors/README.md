# variable vector length extension

## Status
Discussing proposals;

Still open for new proposals!


## Open proposals
- [alex's 1st proposal](./proposal_alex.md)


## Goals
- similar to riscv vector, and ARM SVE
- most code can be vector length independent,
  and automatically scales (in terms of performance) with target's vector length
- possibly replaces a scalar float extension
- relatively easy and cheap to implement
